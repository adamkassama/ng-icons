# Ng Icons (Fork)

This a fork from [ashley-hunter/ng-icons](https://github.com/ashley-hunter/ng-icons) to support custom stroke-width specification.

---

The all in one icon library for Angular. This allows you to use icons from multiple icon sets with a single icon component.

Currently we support the following libraries:

- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Jam Icons](https://jam-icons.com/)
- [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons)
- [Radix UI Icons](https://icons.modulz.app/)
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)

Got suggestions for additional iconsets? Create an issue and we can consider adding them!

## Installation

Ng Icons is comprised of multiple packages:

- `@ng-icons/core` - This contains the icon component and the `NgIconsModule` that is used to register the icons you want to include in your application.
- `@ng-icons/heroicons` - The Heroicons iconset including both outline and solid variants.
- `@ng-icons/feather-icons` - The Feather Icons iconset.
- `@ng-icons/jam-icons` - The Jam Icons iconset.
- `@ng-icons/octicons` - The Octicons iconset.
- `@ng-icons/radix-icons` - The Radix UI iconset.
- `@ng-icons/tabler-icons` - The Tabler iconset.

You must install the `@ng-icons/core` package, however you only need to install the iconset libraries you intend to use.

E.g:

```bash
npm i @ng-icons/core @ng-icons/heroicons ...
```

or

```bash
yarn add @ng-icons/core @ng-icons/heroicons ...
```

## Usage

Import the `NgIconsModule` and register the icons you wish to use:

```ts
import { NgIconsModule } from '@ng-icons/core';
import { FeatherAirplay } from '@ng-icons/feather-icons';
import { HeroUsers } from '@ng-icons/heroicons';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    NgIconsModule.withIcons({ FeatherAirplay, HeroUsers }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can register icons in multiple modules, this allows icons to be lazy loaded in child modules.

You can then use the icon in your templates:

```html
<ng-icon name="feather-airplay"></ng-icon>
```

Additionally there is a `size` input which allows you to specify the size of the icon as a CSS size value. By default icons are set to `1em` which will make them the same size as the font set on it's container.
